# Learning about Version Control


Solving merge conflicts takes conscious effort, but I can do it!

I liked that version control the most that we can each create another branch where you can work by myself. I found this very convenient and efficient since we do not have to deal with all the frequent changes that collaborators make. Moreover, even if it has a merge conflict, now we learned how to fix it so no more frustration!

What I found the most challenging is that it is hard to undo/redo the mistake if I commit and push the work. I felt like I would panic if I push the wrong things or makes mistake on Github.
